Our plan for this project is to create a robust tool that allows players to create, track, and maintain characters & campaigns in an online database. We want to put online many of the offline elements of D&D. Things like character creation, stat tracking, equipment tracking, campaign notes, campaign progress, and DM campaign variables are typically maintained with pen and paper. This tool, if fully realized, could help create an online database to track, analyze, and crowd-source aggregate player data. This data can be used to make the game as paperless as possible. It could also help users see what kind of classes, spells, and tactics are commonly used or most effective for any given campaign. In essence, this tool could help form a metagame for a game-space that typically does not engage in metagames.
